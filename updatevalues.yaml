# Depending on chart version, disable the built-in outputs.
# One of the following usually applies; include the one your chart supports:

backend:
  type: ""        # disables the default 'es' backend

outputs: ""       # or explicitly make outputs empty

# (If your chart has 'elasticsearch.enabled', set it to false)
elasticsearch:
  enabled: false
